## Podcastable!

Podcastable is your home for podcast Recommendations. Built with React and leveraging the ListenNotes API. Search your favorite podcast and get a list of up to 8 recommendations based on the searched value.

This project was originally built using JavaScript (the original can be found here: https://github.com/sjlowchappell/podcastable), but I wanted to experiment with TypeScript. Coming from a Java background, I felt like it would be relatively easy to pick up. After setting things up, I was at first a little overwhelmed by both the number of errors, and the type of errors, when putting my JavaScript code into my new TypeScript files. However, after taking some time to fix the basic errors (specifying the types for function arguments, etc.), most of those errors disappeared. My biggest pain point was figuring out how to set up interfaces properly so that they would work with my classes, but after some reading of the documentation, everything fell into place. I'm looking forward to playing around more with TypeScript!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
